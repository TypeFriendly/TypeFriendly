Title: Tables

---

It is possible to add tables to text in Markdown. A simple table looks like this:

~~~
First header | Second header
-------------| -------------
Cell content | Cell content
Cell content | Cell content
~~~

> First header | Second header
> -------------| -------------
> Cell content | Cell content
> Cell content | Cell content

The first line contains table headers. The second one are lines that separate the headers from the table rows. The columns are separated with a vertical bar `|`.

Optionally, you may also add the vertical bars before and after each table line:

~~~
| First header | Second header |
|--------------| --------------|
| Cell content | Cell content  |
| Cell content | Cell content  |
~~~

The only content available in table cells are the inline elements, such as emphasis, links, images and code spans.
