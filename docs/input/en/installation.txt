Title: Installation

----
In order to use TypeFriendly, you must have PHP 5.1 or newer installed that supports CLI (command line interface). Extract the archive with the script somewhere in your filesystem. To test, whether it works, run the command line of your operating system, go to the TypeFriendly directory and run the following command:

    [console]
    php typefriendly.php -l en -o xhtml "./docs/"

If everything went good, TypeFriendly should generate an XHTML version of its own documentation.

> [information]
> ### For Windows users ###
> 
> In Linux, `php` command is unsually available by default, but Windows users should also modify some system variables. To do this, go to *Control Panel* and find *System* applet. In the tab *Advanced* select *Environment variables* and you will see a new window. Then, find the variable `PATH` in the *System variables* and click *Edit* to modify its value. **After the semicolon `;`** add the path to the directory, where the `php.exe` file is located, for example: 
> 
>     ...;C:\server\php5\

In the next chapter, we are going to describe, how to create a documentation for your project.
