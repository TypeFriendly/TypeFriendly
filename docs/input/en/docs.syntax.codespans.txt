You have probably already noticed some `fixed width text on a yellow background` inserted directly in the text. It is produced with backtick quotes `` ` `` wrapped around a text we wish to format:

    Use the `print()` function to display some text.
    
> Use the `print()` function to display some text.

The formatted text can be surrounded with double backtick quotes, if it already contains such characters, to create the same effect:

    `` This text contains a backtick quote (`) inside ``
    
> `` This text contains a backtick quote (`) inside ``

If the quote is located at the beginning or end of the span, it can be separated with a single space that will not be displayed:

~~~
A single quote: `` ` ``

A text in backtick quotes: `` `something` ``
~~~

> A single quote: `` ` ``

> A text in backtick quotes: `` `something` ``

> The symbols `<`, `>` and `&` are always escaped inside the code span. The HTML tags are nod parsed then.
