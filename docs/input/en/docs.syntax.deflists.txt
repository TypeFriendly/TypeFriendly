Title: Definition lists

---

Markdown supports a special list format called a definition lists. It consists of a term and an explanation, like in a dictionary. To create a definition list, we write a term in the first line, and in the next one, we put a definition followed by `:` and some spaces.

~~~
Apple
:   Fruit of the apple tree.

Orange
:   Citrus fruit, a type of berry.
~~~

> Apple
> :   Fruit of the apple tree.
> 
> Orange
> :   Citrus fruit, a type of berry.

Definition lists support a group of explanations to the same term or a couple of terms to one explanation:

~~~
Word
:   Unit of language that builds phrases.
:   Fixed-size unit of bits that creates a natural data unit in computers.

TF
TypeFriendly
:   A nice documentation generator written in PHP.

Separating the definitions from terms with one empty line will enclose them into paragraphs.

:   Fruit of the apple tree.

Orange

:   Citrus fruit, a type of berry.
~~~

> Apple
> 
> :   Fruit of the apple tree.
> 
> Banana
> 
> :   Citrus fruit, a type of berry.

Like the ordinary lists, the definition lists may contain other block elements, such as paragraphs or code blocks. They must be followed by four spaces or a tabulation.

Term 1

:   This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

:   The second defintion for the term 1 is also placed inside a
    paragraph, because it is followed with an empty line.

Term 2

:   This definition contains a code block and an ordered list:

        some code

    1.  element 1
    2.  element 2
