Title: Inline HTML

---

If Markdown syntax lacks of some functionality we need, we still can write some parts of the chapter in pure HTML. You do not need any special syntax, etc. - just write in HTML, if you need it.

The only constraint is that the HTML block tags, such as `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>` etc. must be separated with an empty line from the rest of the text and they must not be followed with spaces or tabulation. Otherwise, they would be wrapped with a paragraph. Here is a sample of a HTML table:

~~~
A paragraph

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Something</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Another paragraph
~~~

Beware - in this case the Markdown syntax **is not parsed inside the tags**. You have to use for example, `<strong>` instead of `**emphasis**`.

Span elements, like `<span>`, `<del>` or `<sup>` can be used everywhere. They can also replace some Markdown syntax - feel free to use `<a>` and `<img>` if you do not like the Markdown way.

Markdown syntax is still enabled in the span tags.

Markdown syntax in block elements
=================================

The original Markdown syntax does not allow to parse its own symbols inside block HTML tags. However, the parser has been extended with a special option which turns on the parsing on demand. You must add a special HTML attribute `markdown` whose value is `1`:

~~~
<div markdown="1">
This *Markdown text* is still parsed! Yeah!
</div>
~~~

#### The result:

~~~
<div>

<p>This <em>Markdown text</em> is still parsed! Yeah!</p>

</div>
~~~

The parser recognizes various tag types. For example, if you turn on the syntax for `<p>`, only the span elements will be formatted, and the lists or quote blocks will remain unparsed. In some cases this may lead to problems:

~~~
<table>
<tr>
<td markdown="1">This *Markdown text* is still parsed!</td>
</tr>
</table>
~~~

The table cell accepts both block and span elements, but Markdown will parse only the second ones. If you need some block elements there, use `markdown="block"` attribute instead.
