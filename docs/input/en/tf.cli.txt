Title: Command line interface

----

TypeFriendly is used only from the operating system command line. It supports both Windsows systems and various Unix clones, including Linux. You can call the script in this way:

~~~~
[console]
php ./typefriendly.php
~~~~

In case of Unix system the following should also work:

~~~~
[console]
./typefriendly.php
~~~~

The required parameter is always a path to the documentation directory (it means, to the directory that contains the `settings.ini` and other files). For example:

~~~~
[console]
./typefriendly.php "./docs/"
~~~~

Allowed options that must be provided in the alphabetical order are:

`-c LANGUAGE`
:   a tool for multilingual documentations. It compares the last modification time of the files and shows those ones in the derived language that are not up-to-date. Moreover it looks also for the missing files.

`-l LANGUAGE`
:   generates the documentation in the specified language (by default, the base language is chosen).

`-o OUTPUT`
:   generates the documentation, using the specified output only. It must be listed in the available outputs in the configuration.

Example:

~~~~
[console]
./typefriendly -l en -o xhtml "./docs/"
~~~~

To display the information about TypeFriendly, call the script without any parameters.
