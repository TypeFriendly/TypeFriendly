TypeFriendly is an utility tool written in PHP5 designed to generate and publish various texts in HTML formats, such as project documentations, user manuals, books and articles. It has been designed to be easy in use and it allows to achieve the first results immediately, a couple of minutes after you start the work. The script contains everything you need to write a clear, multilingual user manual or book, so that you do not have to implement the whole content generation framework from scratch.
