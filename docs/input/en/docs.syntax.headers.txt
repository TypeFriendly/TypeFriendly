Title: Headers

---

Markdown supports two header systems: **Setext** and **atx**. Like paragraphs, they are block elements, which means that they must be separated with at least one empty line from other elements of the same type.

Setext notation
---------------

Here, the headers are "optically" underlined with equality characters `=` (first level) or pauses `-` (second level).

~~~
Header 1
========

Header 2
--------
~~~

The number of underline characters has no matter.

atx notation
-----------

This method supports all the header levels, using one to six hash symbols `#` before the header text.

~~~
# Header 1

## Header 2

##### Header 5
~~~

The text may be optionally ended with the same characters to make the header look better. The number of the characters does not have to match the header level.

~~~
# Header 1 #

## Header 2 ####

##### Header 5 #
~~~

> TypeFriendly makes a small change to the original parser. The header level in the XHTML output is always decreased by 1, because the first level (`<h1>`) is reserved for the chapter title. So, the header written as the first level will be the second level and so on. As a result, TypeFriendly supports up to 5 levels, not 6.
