Title: Code blocks
SeeAlso:

There are two ways of making pre-formatted code blocks. The first one is to insert four spaces or a tabulation before every line of the code:

~~~
Some paragraph here...

    <?php
    $part = "of our source code";
    if($condition)
    {
        of_script('that we write');
    }
    ?>

Some other paragraph....
~~~

Alternatively, we can insert at least three consecutive tildes `~` before and after the code block.

> It is very important to write the same number of tildes in those two places.

~~~~~~
Some paragraph here...

~~~
<?php
$part = "of our source code";
of_script('that we write');
?>
~~~

Some other paragraph.
~~~~~~

However, this method does not allow to insert a code block into information frames or lists.

Syntax highlighting
===================

TypeFriendly extends the code blocks with a feature of syntax highlighting. It is produced by [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/). The list of supported languages is available at the library website.

To turn on the syntax highlighting, we put the name of the language in square brackets: `[language]` in the line just before the code block. The language name must correspond to the language rule file in the `/vendor/geshi/geshi` directory.

#### Sample use

~~~~~~
~~~
[php]
<?php
$part = "of our source code";
of_script('that we write');
?>
~~~
~~~~~~

#### Result

~~~
[php]
<?php
$part = "of our source code";
of_script('that we write');
?>
~~~

The additional "language" is `console`, which changes the layout of the frame with the code to look like a operating system command line (dark background, white text):

    [console]
    php typefriendly.php build "./docs/"

> ### How to turn off the highlighting? ###
> 
> If a code block already contains a text enclosed in square brackets in the first line (for example, in INI files), follow it with a backslash symbol and the line will be displayed as a part of the code, not as turning on the syntax highlighting:
> 
>     \\[group]
>     key = "in ini file"
> 
> Of course, this applies only to the first line of the code block.
