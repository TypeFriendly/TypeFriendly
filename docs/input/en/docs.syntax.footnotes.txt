Title: Footnotes

---

Footnotes work like the link references. They consist of two elements: the superscripted link in the text and the footnote definition at the end of the document.

~~~
This is a text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is a footnote.
~~~

> This is a text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is a footnote.

The footnote definitions can be located in any place, but they will be always displayed at the end of the document in the order they have been specified.


> [important]
> It is not possible to create two references to the same note. If you do this, the next notes will not be replaced.

Each footnote must have an unique name. It doesn't have to be a number - it can be also a text label.

> [important]
> The footnote name is used in the addresses and **it does not influence** the footnotes in the text.

The footnote name must be a valid value of an `ID` attribute in HTML.

> [information]
> TypeFriendly includes a chapter name to the footnote names.

Footnotes accept block elements, like paragraphs, lists, code blocks etc. All we need is to follow them with four spaces or a tabulation:

~~~
This is a text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is a footnote.

    Another paragraph of the footnote.
~~~

Markdown allows the first line to remain empty:

~~~
This is a text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: 
    This is a footnote.

    Another paragraph of the footnote.
