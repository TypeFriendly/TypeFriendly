Title: Directory structure

----
The TypeFriendly documentation must have a proper directory structure. Create a new directory somewhere in your project (for example, `/docs`) and make there the following folders and files:

    /input
        /en
    /output
    /sort_hints.txt
    /settings.ini

The rules are imple. In `/input`, there are directories representing various language versions. Inside them, we place text files with the content. Optionally, we may want to create here a directory named `/media` with images and other graphics used in the manual. TypeFriendly generates the output files to the `/output` directory, so it must have some write access there. Directly in the main directory, we put the configuration files. The most important is `settings.ini` with the configuration. `sort_hints.txt` contains our own sorting rules. In the next chapters, we will describe, what they must contain.
